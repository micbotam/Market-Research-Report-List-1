<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Primary Antibody Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monoclonal Antibodies</li><li>Polyclonal Antibody</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The primary antibody market is divided into two main types: monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies are identical immune cells that target a specific antigen, providing high specificity and consistency, making them ideal for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. In contrast, polyclonal antibodies consist of a mixture of different antibody molecules, recognizing various epitopes on the same antigen, which allows for a broader immune response. This diversity makes polyclonal antibodies valuable for certain research and therapeutic applications but may introduce variability.</p></p>
