<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Hyperbaric Oxygen Chamber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Pressurized</li><li>Oxygen Pressurized</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical hyperbaric oxygen chamber market comprises two primary types: air pressurized and oxygen pressurized chambers. Air pressurized chambers utilize compressed air to create higher ambient pressure, allowing patients to breathe normally while receiving increased oxygen levels. Oxygen pressurized chambers, on the other hand, deliver pure oxygen at higher pressures, significantly enhancing oxygen absorption and promoting healing for various medical conditions. Both types serve critical roles in treatments such as decompression sickness, non-healing wounds, and infections.</p></p>
