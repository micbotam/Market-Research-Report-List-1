<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impedance Muffler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Expansion</li><li>Resonance Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Impedance Muffler Market is characterized by two primary types: Expansion Mufflers and Resonance Mufflers. Expansion Mufflers utilize a larger volume chamber to reduce exhaust noise by allowing gases to expand and dissipate sound waves. Resonance Mufflers, on the other hand, leverage specific chamber designs that create sound wave interferences, effectively canceling out unwanted frequencies. Both types focus on optimizing sound control and enhancing vehicle performance while adhering to regulations on noise emissions.</p></p>
