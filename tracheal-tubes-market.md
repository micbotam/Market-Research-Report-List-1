<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tracheal Tubes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tracheostomy Tubes</li><li>EndoTracheal Tubes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The tracheal tubes market consists primarily of two types: tracheostomy tubes and endotracheal tubes. Tracheostomy tubes are surgically placed into the trachea for patients requiring long-term airway access, often used in cases of chronic respiratory conditions. Endotracheal tubes, on the other hand, are inserted through the mouth or nose into the trachea and are typically used for short-term ventilation during surgeries or critical care situations. Both types facilitate respiratory management and enhance patient outcomes in various medical settings.</p></p>
