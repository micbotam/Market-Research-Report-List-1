<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Indoor Farming Lighting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Halogen</li><li>LED</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Indoor farming lighting primarily comprises two market types: halogen and LED lights. Halogen lights emit a warm light and offer high-intensity illumination, which can benefit certain growth stages but waste energy through heat production. In contrast, LED lights are energy-efficient, long-lasting, and provide customizable spectral output, allowing growers to optimize light conditions for various crops. While halogen lights are still used, LEDs are increasingly favored for their lower operational costs and environmental benefits, making them the dominant choice in modern indoor farming.</p></p>
